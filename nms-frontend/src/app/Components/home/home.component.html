       <h1> Who are we?</h1>
       <p style="padding-right:10%">
         The U.S. still trails nearly all other advanced countries in helping children reach their full potential despite major advances for children over the past 30 years. Across the nation, 1 in every 7 children experiences shockingly high rates of hunger, school dropouts, teenage pregnancy and/or child death. 

         Educating children gives them the tools to fight poverty, be healthy and safe. That's why we're working in the U.S. to ensure every child has access to a quality education, right from the start.  Every child deserves a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. Yet, an estimated 5.4 million children under age 5 still die each year from preventable causes, 250 million children around the world can’t read, despite years of schooling, and far too many children are experiencing physical and emotional abuse, sexual exploitation, deprivation and neglect. 

         That's why as global leaders in child health, education and protection, we're working in more than 100 countries to change the lives of over 100 million children every year.

      <h1> What we do?</h1>
      <p>
        Believe it or not, in 1919, when Eglantyne Jebb founded Save the Children, her conviction that children have the right to grow up healthy, educated and safe was not a mainstream idea.  Much has changed since then. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, based on our founder’s declaration, is now the most universally accepted human rights treaty in history. And, through our work in the United States and around the world, we've changed the lives of over 1 billion children. We work in over 100 countries, doing whatever it takes — every day and in times of crisis — to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. Thanks to our supporters, we achieve tremendous results for children. In 2019 alone, we reached over 144 million children, including 328,000 here in America. As the world's leading expert on childhood, we believe that every child deserves a future. This belief is at the heart of everything we do. We know you share it, too.</p>
